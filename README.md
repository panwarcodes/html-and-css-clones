# HTML & CSS Clones

This repository is a collection of website UI clones built using **only HTML and CSS**.  
The goal is to strengthen my fundamentals and get better at building clean, responsive layouts from scratch.

No frameworks. No JavaScript. Just core web basics.

## Why this repo exists

I’m using this space to:
- Practice semantic HTML structure
- Improve CSS layout skills (Flexbox, Grid, positioning)
- Get better with spacing, alignment, and responsiveness
- Build consistency by recreating real-world UIs

Each project focuses on learning something new, even if the design looks simple.

## What’s inside

- Static UI clones of popular or interesting websites
- Built using only HTML & CSS
- Responsive layouts where possible
- Clean, readable, and well-structured code

## How to use

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open any project folder  
3. Run the HTML file directly in your browser

## Notes

These clones are built for **learning purposes only**.  
They are not intended to be perfect replicas or production-ready projects.

## What’s next

I’ll keep adding more clones as I learn and improve.  
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
